## 👩🏽‍🍳 The Process

We had to create a flutter application about a subject we had to chose ourself. For our project we chose fitness.

Before working jumping straight in the coding part we took our time laying the foundation on how our app is going to look like in figma. So that afterwards we just had to 'recreate' the screens. This helped us a lot.

So now it was time to code everything up. I started by making the start screen which wasn't much work. After that I had to create the second screen which used the local jsonAPI. The was easier said then done because just typing "localhost" doesn't work. For this I used ngrok.exe to make a secure tunnle.

For the wikitude part we also had a couple issues that were solved relatively quick. Sad part is we made this but by time I'm typing this wikitude isn't available anymore.

## 📚 What I Learned

During this project, I learned how to work with flutter / dart and how to set up a local json server. Aswel as work with wikitude to create a AR/VR experience.

### 🧠 Brain:

- **Logical Thinking**: What really was a bit dumb was the local json server. This required some logical thinking.

### ⌚ Time management:

- **Using scrum board**: Keeping track of all our tasks using a scrum board really made everything organised. For this project we used Trello.

### 📓 New knowledge:

- **Flutter / Dart**: During this project we created a good basis for Flutter / Dart.
- **Figma**: Before working on our project we made all of our screens in figma.

### 📈 Overall Growth:

This project really helped me understand Flutter and Dart aswell as the basics of AR/VR development in wikitude.

## 💭 How can it be improved?

- Better api security
- Implementing more features
- Improving our AR/VR part

## 🚦 Running the Project

To run the project in your local environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `json-server --watch db.json` to run the local json server.
3. Change the ip in the API
4. Run the project to get started.
5. Open your phone to see the appliciation
